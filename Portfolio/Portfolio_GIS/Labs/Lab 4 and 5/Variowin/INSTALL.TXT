			*****************************
			*WHY NO INSTALLATION PROGRAM*
			*****************************
This INSTALL.TXT file replaces an install program which would have outdated too
quickly because of the foreseen change from MS-WINDOWS 3.1 to MS-WINDOWS 4.0 and
MS-WINDOWS NT. This  is why the user is requested to perform the "manual" installation
described in this file.

			**********************
			*MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS*
			**********************

The programs contained in the VARIOWIN package will run on any PC with a 386, or above, 
processor running MS-WINDOWS 3.1 or later. The coprocessor is strongly recommended
because of the intensive computation performed within VARIOWIN.
The package requires approximately 2 MB on a hard disk.

			************************

			*INSTALLING VARIOWIN VERSION 2.1*
			*********************************

1) Create a directory, C:\VARIOWIN would be fine, in which you will copy the file 
   VARIOWIN.ZIP and the program PKUNZIP.EXE.

   (you can also use the FILE MANAGER within WINDOWS)
   The help file must be in your WINDOWS directory if you want to access it
   from within the VARIOWIN applications.  

5) The help file requires the True Type font FENCES and MT EXTRA to display its 
   content adequately. They could not be included in the release because they
   are copyrighted by Microsoft. However, they are provided with most text
   processors that come with an equation editor.
   These font must be installed on your system using the FONTS program found
   in the CONTROL PANEL under the MAIN group of the program manager. The dialog

   select. Then you will be able to browse through your directories :
   1) go to the directory containing your fonts

      and click OK. Your WIN.INI file will be modified to take this new fonts
