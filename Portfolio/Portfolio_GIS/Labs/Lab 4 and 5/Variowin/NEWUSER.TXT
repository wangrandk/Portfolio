Hello from Lausanne,

VARIOWIN 2.1 is finally available for the community. This is the
version that will be presented in my phD by the end of the year.
I would greatly appreciate any user's comment or reviews on the
programs that I could include in my oral presentation.

The rest of this message is a welcome message for new users of VARIOWIN 
Version 2.1. It also describes under what conditions the package 
is made available to the community.

Thanks for your interest in VAROWIN. Your name has been added to my 
mailing list and you will be kept informed of future releases. 

Improvements from version 1.0 include :
- Exhaustive methodological help on line developed for teaching purposes.
- Sample map and variogram surfaces which always have a correct aspect ratio.
- Several pairs can be selected and located on a h-scatterplot and on a 
  variogram cloud.
- Calculation of a variogram surface includes zero distance pairs.
- Increased ease in modeling a 2D variogram.
- The same 2D model can be checked against several experimental measures
  of spatial continuity.
- A 2D model can be saved as a grid file allowing its representation 
  as a variogram surface.

Improvements from version 2.0 include :
- Replacement of the Standardized Inverted (Cross) Covariance by the
  Standardized (Cross) Semivariogram. This new measure of spatial continuity
  has properties similar to the general relative variogram.
- Ability to handle data sets with UTM coordinates.
- Possibility to modify the parameters of a 2D general model of spatial continuity not only via scrollbars but also by entering values with the keyboard.
- Easier interaction with (cross) variogram clouds.
- Ability to read data files with empty lines at the end of the file.
- Better look of the various graphs produced by VARIO2DP and MODEL.

The package is a freeware and not a public domain package. This means 
it can be used and demonstrated as long as the about dialog box which 
also appears when a program starts is not modified. This box displays 
my name and address so that every user has a chance to contact me if 
anything goes wrong. It also means that you must acknowledge using VARIOWIN
when you publish results obtained with the help of those Programs.

Please DO NOT DISTRIBUTE the package to your interested coworkers. 
You should rather suggest them to contact me via email so that they can 
get be added to the mailing list.

Every user which sends me a mail is being added to the mailing list to 
which I send a message every time a significant modification has been 
made on any of the programs.

Source code is not being distributed at this stage of the project. 
Further developments are being made in the field of Exploratory 
Variography and I would like to make them myself.

The current reference for the package is the paper MS-WINDOWS 
PROGRAMS FOR EXPLORATORY VARIOGRAPHY AND VARIOGRAM MODELING IN 2D 
published in "Statistics of Spatial Processes: Theory and Applications
BARI, ITALY sep. 27-30 1993" Edited by Capasso V., Girone G. & Posa D.
pp. 165-170  
Other articles describing the programs have been and will be submitted
to international reviews. People on the mailing list will be advised
whenever a new article on the subject is being published.

Welcome to the group and enjoy playing with your data...

                              Regards,

HOW TO RETRIEVE THE PROGRAMS VIA ANONYMOUS FTP
**********************************************
from any machine connected to the Internet do the following commands :

1) c:\variowin>ftp ulimin1.unil.ch   OR   c:\variowin>ftp 130.223.104.13
2) login as ftp  OR  as anonymous
3) As a password type in your email address or anything
4) ftp>cd /pub/geostat
5) ftp>bin
6) ftp>get variowin.zip
7) ftp>get pkunzip.exe
8) ftp>bye

At this stage VARIOWIN.ZIP, and the program PKUNZIP.EXE
have been transfered to your machine. VARIOWIN can be unzipped using the 
command :

	9) c:\variowin\pkunzip -o variowin

and you can proceed with the installation according to the instructions given
in the file INSTALL.TXT.

FORESEEN CHANGE IN THE ANONYMOUS FTP SERVER
*******************************************
From August 1994, the archive file variowin.zip will also be available from the anonymous
ftp server "eliot.unil.ch" in the directory /pub/geostat. This site will gradually take 
over "ulimin1.unil.ch".
